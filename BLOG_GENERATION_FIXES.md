# Blog Generation Issues - Fixed

## Problems Identified & Fixed

### Issue 1: Repetitive Generic Titles with "in 2025"

**User Input Topics:**
1. "What Recent AI Developments Mean for Business Leaders" with type `analysis`
2. "The Other Side of the AI Hype" with type `reality-check`

**Generated Titles (BAD):**
1. "The Hidden Truth About AI Adoption in 2025: Leaders Take Note"
2. "The Hidden Truth About AI's 42% Project Failure Rate in 2025"

**Problems:**
- Both titles start with "The Hidden Truth About..." showing pattern repetition
- Both unnecessarily add "in 2025" making titles dated
- Original user topics completely ignored

### Issue 2: Duplicate Section Titles in Content

**Example:**
```
## Future Outlook and Preparing for Next-Gen AI

Future Outlook and Preparing for Next-Gen AI

[actual content starts here...]
```

**Problem:**
- Section title was being repeated as the first line of body text
- Creates awkward redundancy and looks unprofessional

## Changes Made

### Fix 1: Blog Title Generation (lines 422-439)

**File**: `scripts/blog-generator/blog-generator.js`

**Added:**
- Explicit requirement to honor the user's original topic
- Instruction to AVOID adding "in 2025" unless essential
- 7 diverse title format options (not just templates)
- Strong anti-repetition instructions
- Preference for timeless titles

### Fix 2: Voice Framework Templates

**File**: `scripts/blog-generator/config/voice-framework.json`

**Removed year-based patterns, added timeless templates**

### Fix 3: Section Content Generation (lines 370-375)

**File**: `scripts/blog-generator/blog-generator.js`

**Added CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:**
- Do NOT repeat the section title in the body text
- Begin immediately with first paragraph of content
- Start with topic sentence, not title restatement

## Expected Results

### Better Titles
✅ "What Recent AI Developments Mean for Business Leaders"
✅ "AI Developments Every Business Leader Should Know"
❌ NOT "The Hidden Truth About AI Adoption in 2025"

### Clean Sections
✅ No duplicated titles in content body
✅ Content starts with engaging topic sentence

## Testing

```bash
pnpm blog:generate "Your Test Topic Here" analysis
```

Check:
- Title matches your input topic
- No "in 2025" unless essential
- Section titles not duplicated in body text
