#### When I click on h1 tag, add classname "show" to the "#content" div and use css animation to bring the content block into view  

To achieve this, we'll need to use JavaScript to add the "show" class to the "#content" div when the h1 tag is clicked. We'll also need to define the CSS animation to bring the content block into view.

Here's an example of how you could implement this:

index.html
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="header">Click me!</h1>
    <div id="content">
        <!-- Your content here -->
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed sit amet nulla auctor, vestibulum magna sed, convallis ex.</p>
    </div>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

styles.css
```
#content {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(100px);
    transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out;
}

#content.show {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
}
```

script.js
```javascript
document.getElementById('header').addEventListener('click', function() {
    document.getElementById('content').classList.add('show');
});
```

In this example, when the h1 tag with the id "header" is clicked, the JavaScript code adds the "show" class to the div with the id "content". The CSS animation then brings the content block into view by changing its opacity and transforming its position.

Note that this is just one way to achieve this effect, and you can customize the animation and styles to fit your needs.
